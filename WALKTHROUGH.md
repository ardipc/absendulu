## Database Schema

### Tables Used

#### `companies`
```sql
- id (uuid, primary key)
- name (text)
- address (text)
- phone (text)
- owner_id (uuid, foreign key to auth.users)
- created_at (timestamp)
```

#### `sites`
```sql
- id (uuid, primary key)
- name (text)
- latitude (float)
- longitude (float)
- radius (integer)
- company_id (uuid, foreign key to companies)
- created_at (timestamp)
```

- name (text)
- email (text)
- role (text)
- phone (text)
- company (uuid, foreign key to companies)
- created_at (timestamp)
```

## Authentication & Authorization

### Server-Side Checks (`+page.server.ts`)
1. **Session Validation**: Checks if user is authenticated
   - If not authenticated â†’ Redirect to `/login`
2. **Duplicate Prevention**: Checks if user already has a company
   - If company exists â†’ Redirect to `/dashboard`

### Client-Side Checks (`+page.svelte`)
1. **LocalStorage Check**: On mount, checks if `walkthrough_completed` is true
   - If true â†’ Redirect to `/dashboard`

## Implementation Details

### State Management
The page uses Svelte 5 runes for reactive state:
- `$state()`: For form inputs and UI state
- `$props()`: For receiving server data

### Form Submission
Each step has its own submit handler:
- `handleCompanySubmit()`: Creates company and stores `companyId`
- `handleLocationSubmit()`: Creates location linked to `companyId`
- `handleEmployeeSubmit()`: Creates employee linked to `companyId`

### Error Handling
- Try-catch blocks for database operations
- User-friendly alert messages
- Loading states during submissions
- Form validation with required fields

### Geolocation API
The `getCurrentLocation()` function:
- Requests user permission for location access
- Automatically fills latitude and longitude fields
- Provides error feedback if location access is denied

## Styling

### Design System
- **Colors**: 
  - Step 1 (Company): Blue/Cyan gradient
  - Step 2 (Location): Green/Emerald gradient
  - Step 3 (Employee): Purple/Pink gradient
- **Components**: Rounded cards, gradient backgrounds, shadow effects
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design with `md:` breakpoints

### Animations
- Hover effects on buttons and steps
- Scale transitions on interactive elements
- Smooth color transitions

## Integration Points

### After Walkthrough Completion
1. Set `localStorage.setItem('walkthrough_completed', 'true')`
2. Set `localStorage.setItem('company_id', companyId)`
3. Show success message: "Setup berhasil! Selamat datang di AbsenDulu ðŸŽ‰"
4. Redirect to `/dashboard`

### Recommended Login/Signup Flow
```
User Signs Up â†’ Email Verification â†’ Login â†’ /started (walkthrough) â†’ /dashboard
```

### Skip Walkthrough Flow
```
User Clicks "Skip" â†’ Confirm Dialog â†’ Set localStorage â†’ Redirect to /dashboard
```
